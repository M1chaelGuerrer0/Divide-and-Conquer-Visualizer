            Divide and Conquer basic idea
        </h2>
        <p>The divide and conquer approach involves breaking a problem into smaller subproblems,
            and once the solutions to the subproblems are found they are combined to obtain a final solution. </p>

            Examples of Divide and Conquer
        </h2>
        <p>
            Some common examples of divide and conquer algorithms include binary search and merge sort.

        <h2> Binary Search</h2>
        <p>
            Binary seach is a searching algorithm that finds the position of target element within a sorted array.
            The algorithm works by constantly dividing the search interval in half.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>compare the middle element with the target element</li>
            <li>if the target element is equal to the middle element, the search is complete</li>
            <li>if the target element is less than the middle element, search the left half of the array</li>
            <li>if the target element is greater than the middle element, search the right half of the array</li>
            <li>repeat the process until the target element is found or the interval is empty</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Merge Sort</h2>
        <p>
            Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that uses the divide and conquer approach to sort an array.
            The algorithm works by recursively dividing the array into two halves, sorting each half and then merging them back together resulting
            in a sorted array.
